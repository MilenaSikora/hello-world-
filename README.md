# hello-world-
The first step in journey of coding.
I'd like to make a great project in C for LITG
Project name: My foreign wor(l)d
Specification of the project: Game for children to be downloaded. Programm allows children to learn new word in foreign language (fr this project it will be french) based on paitings they see in each part. Programm display particular paint and four words below. When user choose correct word (by click), then new paint and words show. When user choose wrong word, then comment shows that he/she should try one more time.
